# EnvOpenAudio
 An open source headphone/PC speaker project utilizing the RP2040, UDA1334A and TPA2016

## Why
I like the idea of using the RP2040 for as many things as possible and since I made my own type-c version of the pico and my phone doesnt have a 3.5mm jack its a nice little bonus... I was also thinking I could use a Tiny2040 since its even smaller than a Pro Micro style board and also has all 4 Analogue GPIOs.

## I will need help
Im not a programmer, the most I can do is scripting in bash and python, that said I need someone who can do C stuff, although there is an example for using the Rpi pico as a I2S USB Sound Card it doesnt fully function, it functions enough to use for a while but mute doesnt work and eventually USB will die off for some reason.

## Contributions
Feel free to make a PR if you want to provide your own 3d modeled housings for 3d printable speakers housings or headphone cups, Ill obviously be modeling my own but its always nice to see how people approach things.

## to do list (In no particular order)
- [x] Make Functional Concept
- [ ] Firmware
- [ ] PC Speaker Housinds
- [ ] Headphone cups and band
- [ ] Custom smaller PCBs of I2S Decoder and amp.
- [x] ~~Meow at wall for 3 hours~~

## Currently working on (as of last updating this)
- 3d printed housing for speakers, small desktop style pc speakers
