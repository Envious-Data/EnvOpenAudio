# I NEED HELP!

So I am not able to do much more than basic scripting and I'd love if someone could help out by providing a simple firmware for the RP2040 for this project


This example does almost everything I need except it seems to exhibit some bugs so I will be using this to test and work on this project but yeah, need someone to do the firmware bits.

## tl:dr:
need firmware for rp2040 to make it USB I2S DAC.

### bonus features
- a basic EQ to adjust sound a bit incase you use different kinds of speakers to me
- i2c volume control for tpa2016 via rotary encoder? (undecided)
