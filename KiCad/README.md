These board schematics are from adafruit, Ive imported them into KiCad and swapped the footprints to KiCad version, I will be attempting to make these boards smaller as well as removing some stuff I wont use but the good thing about this is if you want you can build this project out of such parts you can buy from adafruit or equivilent shops minus the 3d printed housings.
